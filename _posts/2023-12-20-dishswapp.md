DishSwapp is a digital cookbook where you can post and keep track of your favorite recipes. It is also a place where you can see and interact with other recipes posted by other users. I built this using Sanity CMS and React JS as a fun side project. The app is styled with Bootstrap, Mantine components and custom CSS.
